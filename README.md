# unity_test_project
My first unity project

This is the first unity that i have tried creating by myself, there is no source code upload, as all the code and the assets + the pixel art is created by myself

So i would like to keep it private.

The following gif will showcase the game

The game character is moving in a 2D map, and have collision wall which prevent it to go over.

I also implement jumping mechanism in a 2D map, with some parabolic formula, so the jump looks smooth and natural.

All the pixel art and the animation exists in the demo was created by myself

The code itself is written in C#, and i am still a beginner in this language, but im comfortable with object oriented programming
